# YOLOScope

# The code is ready for use 
But I plan to add more functionalities to make it more handy for use :)

Important first step!! 

1. Download the YOLOv4 weights and model 
```
# The folder where the weights will be saved
%mkdir model

%cd model
!wget https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v3_optimal/yolov4.weights
!wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/cfg/yolov4.cfg
!wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/master/data/coco.names
```
